# Sunny
A personal project to learn about emulation and low-level programming

## Build
Sunny is currently only supported on Windows, it uses a unity build system, so compiling and running is a simple build script.
Vulkan SDK 1.2 or higher is required for the hardware renderer, and thats all for dependencies.

Note that a valid BIOS file is required to run the application

## TODO
Given this emulator is in its very early stages, major components such as the GTE or SPU have not been completed.
Some components that are upcoming however:
- Joypad emulation
- GPU completion
- Proper Vsync timings
- Proper DMA timings
