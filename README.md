# Sunny
A personal project to learn about emulation and low-level programming

## Build
Sunny is currently only supported on Windows, CMake is used to build the project.
Vulkan SDK 1.2 or higher is required for the hardware renderer.

Note that a valid BIOS file is required to run the application.

## TODO
Given this emulator is in its very early stages, some major components are missing.
Some components that are upcoming however:
- CDROM emulation
- GPU completion
- Proper Vsync timings
- Proper DMA timings
